## üìù Notes & Limitations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Precautions When Using the Service
- Ensure API endpoints requiring authentication are protected with proper middleware.
- Do not expose sensitive environment variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in public repositories.
- Avoid using seeded dummy data in production environments.
- Avoid using seeded dummy data with large seed at the same time.
- Avoid seeding columns that are supposed to contain uploaded file URLs in cloud storage. Doing so will cause errors when using features that modify the file, since the uploaded file URL will be invalid.

### üß± Technical Limitations
- Telegram bot polling may cause delays or downtime if the server experiences high load. 
- Google Maps‚Äô interface shows an alert popup and logs errors in the console due to the free plan limitations.

### üêû Known Issues
- Limitation when using Firebase Storage for free plan Firebase Service, upgrade to Blaze Plan to use more.
- There are limitations when using the Google Maps API with the free plan. Upgrade your plan in the Google Cloud Console to access additional features.
